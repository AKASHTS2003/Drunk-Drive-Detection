# Drunk-Drive-Detection 🚗🍻  

Developed a real-time application using **Flutter** to detect drunk driving based on sensory data and image processing. This project integrates **authentication, REST API implementation, and real-time sensor data monitoring** to identify intoxicated drivers proactively.  

Since this is an internship project, I will provide only my work. A screen recording of the application demonstration is linked below.  

## 🚀 Features Implemented  
✅ **Frontend Development using Flutter**  
✅ **User Authentication**
