# Drunk-Drive-Detection
Developed a real-time application that utilizes sensory data to detect drunk driving. The project involved advanced image processing, sensor data analysis, and real-time monitoring techniques. Since this is an internship project, I will provide only my work. A screen recording of the application demonstration is linked below.
